According to the statement of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, the cruiser sank as a result of a fire, which in turn led to the detonation of ammunition; the cause of the fire is not known.

The Moskva cruiser was the third largest warship of the Russian Navy and the largest and most armed in the Black Sea Fleet.

In a commentary to a CNN correspondent, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Oleksiy Danilov replied that the Moskva cruiser was not far from Snake Island and was hit by two "powerful Ukrainian-made missiles"[^1]

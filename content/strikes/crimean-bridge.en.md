The explosion on the Crimean bridge occurred on the morning of Saturday October 8, 2022. The explosion collapsed about 250 meters of the roadbed, burned seven tanks of a freight train.

Several people died. Traffic on the bridge was completely stopped, which was the first such case since the day it was launched.
